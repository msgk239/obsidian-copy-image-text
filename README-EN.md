## Development Notes

This plugin is developed using TypeScript. If you want to contribute:

1. After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. After modifying the TypeScript source code, run `npm run build` to compile.
3. The compiled `main.js` file is not included in version control but needs to be manually included in releases.

Note: When publishing a new version, make sure to run `npm run build` first, then add the generated `main.js` file to the release package.

## Notes

- Image size is limited to 10MB, images exceeding this size will not be copied
- Some special formatting may not be fully preserved in certain target applications
- Please ensure you have the right to copy and share the images contained in your notes
- Tips for using Markdown format copy:
  - If you want to publish your document to GitHub or blog platforms, follow these steps:
    1. Use an editor that supports image bed upload (e.g., Typora + PicList)
    2. Upload the images in your document to an image bed (tested in Typora)
    3. This will convert your images to online links
    4. Then you can simply copy the entire document, as all images are now online links
  - Obsidian might have similar image bed upload plugins available (untested)
